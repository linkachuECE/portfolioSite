                    <h3>Radio Communication using STM32</h3>

                    <div class="description">
                        <p>In this project, I used two STM32F103C8T6's (better known as a "Bluepill")
                        to interface with the nRF24L01 Radio module using the SPI interface.<br>
                        I wrote a driver that was able to successfully transmit and receive packets of information, and I used this ability to control the position
                        of a servo motor attached to one of the Bluepills using an analog joystick remote on the other.<br>
                        During this project, I learned a lot about STM32 devices, PWM, SPI, and UART which I used extensively for debugging. I also made liberal use of a logic analyzer using the Saleae Logic Software</p>

                    <p>I started Electrical Engineering Technology at John A. Logan College in 2019. While there, 
                    I learned the fundamentals of circuit design, both analog and digital.
                    I had the opportunity to learn how to use Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and PLC ladder logic.<br>
                    After that, I transferred to Southern Illinois University, where I am currently studing Computer Engineering.
                    I've learned about such topics as operating systems, Linux, algorithms, and electrical circuit design.<br>
                    My first internship was with EMAC Inc., a local company specializing in embedded circuit board design. During my
                    time there, I gained a lot of exposure to the hardware and software devlopment cycle, and got to use tools such as Altium and
                    LTSpice. I regularly reviewed and interpreted schematics and created parts for our internal database. I also helped with
                    testing and verifying boards, and also added functionality to a command-line tool for using PWM on one of our custom boards.<br>
                    My second internship was at Hunter Engineering Company, where I worked regularly on an extensive C++ codebase to complete bug fixes
                    and implement new features into the company's tire balancers. While there, I learned more about multi-threaded applications, 
                    event-driven programming and GUI design. I also regularly worked with Visual Studio and GDB.</p>
